The two dated for a while before realizing they were the one for each other. They took their relationship to the next level by officially engaging with each other on <strong>March 27, 2014</strong>. That's the same month <a href=# rel=nofollow>Savannah Guthrie married </a><a href=# rel=nofollow>Michael Feldman</a>.</p><p>The romantic couple Elaine&nbsp; & Eduardo has been living a successful married life since then. They have not made their marriage a subject of drama for the media.

Not everyone has money to afford things they want, but her husband is a successful entrepreneur and one rich man. Elaine, herself hasn't disclosed her wealth.</p><p>However, her husband, Eduardo Saverin, has a massive net worth. He is a billionaire with a net worth of <strong>$13.4 billion</strong>. <i>Bloomberg</i> claims that Meta is where the majority of the wealth comes from.

Per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mara Siegler from <i>PageSix</i></a>, <i>Glamurama</i> had reported in <strong>2015</strong> that he was going to marry Rachel on <strong>June 27</strong>. It turned about to be just a fake story as all of the rumors were cleared to the media by his spokesperson Tom Goodman.

He was also the first investor in the company. But he is no longer working at the company. But why?</p><p>Almost everyone has heard of the famous story that Mark Zuckerberg got rid of him from the company. So, why did one best friend's relationship end up like this?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/4/mark-zuckerberg-at-f8-410f7982753d4ed8825c20f89e83acf5%20(1)-1670144645659.jpg><p>Even though many people believe that Zuckerberg's greed was the reason that Eduardo was kicked out of the company. As per the face of the company, Zuck himself, Eduardo, was not doing his work and hence, was fired from the company. He refused to cooperate with the team and didn't go to Palo Alto with the rest of the group.</p><h2>Eduardo Loves Playing Chess</h2><p>Eduardo Saverin is a billionaire, and it wouldn't take a lot to guess that he must be a busy man.

He gets competitive and is good at the popular board game. In fact, at the young age of <strong>13</strong>, he won a massive match against a professional, and <i>The International Chess Magazine</i> even covered the incident.</p><h2>Andrew Garfield Played Him On The Social Network</h2><p>The famous 2010 film <i>The Social Network</i> shows the story of the origin of tech giant Facebook. Based on a true story, the movie had some excellent actors portraying real-life people. In the case of Eduardo, he was played by Andrew Garfield.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>There were many things that the movie got right about Eduardo, but some fictional stories also showed up in the film. Popular YouTube channel <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Watchmojo</i></a> has also covered it. They mentioned that movie scenes of Eduardo freezing the bank account were actual, whereas being Zuck's only friend and feeding meat to a chicken were made-up stories.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eduardo Is No Longer An American Citizen</h2><p>Elaine's husband Eduardo made the news in <strong>2012</strong> when he gave up on his American citizenship. When the news broke out, the consensus among ordinary people was that he was just another capitalist trying to avoid taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>But Elaine's husband has said that the reason he quit his US citizenship had nothing to do with that but rather because he loved Singapore and wanted to live there. He currently lives with his wife in Singapore and will likely grow his family there.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting celebrity bios.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6jmqGemnqiusOroJ6ikaPAtLHN</p></div><div id=links><a href=./katy-perry-tops-maxims-2010-hot-100-list-2010105.html>&#171;&nbsp;Katy Perry Tops Maxim's 2010 Hot 100 List; Angelina No. 38</a>
