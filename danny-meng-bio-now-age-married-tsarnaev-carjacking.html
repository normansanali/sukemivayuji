Incidentally, on April 18, 2013 (3 days after the bombing), the bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev pulled up behind Danny’s car and threatened him with a gun before getting into the vehicle. Then, he was forced to drive to a location in Watertown.</span></p><p><span>Once in Watertown, the bombers then asked Danny to move into the passenger seat as they moved a few boxes from their own car to the SUV. Low on fuel, they then drove off in search of a gas station as they planned on traveling to New York overnight. Luckily, once they found one, Danny took advantage of the distraction and escaped to a second gas station.</span></p><p><span>He then convinced the clerk to allow him to call 911. So, after the police arrived, Danny revealed that his kidnappers confessed to the Boston Marathon Bombing and handed them the GPS tracking number of his car. Not long after, officers tracked the duo and Danny was allowed to return home.</span></p><p><span>For his courageous action, many labeled Danny a hero. But he said that the real heroes were the police and the survivors who taught him an important lesson. “It somehow changed how I think of my life. Every day now is a gift,” he added.</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Danny Meng Now?</b></h3><p><span>Danny Meng might have suffered PTSD from the incident, but he’s all better now. Today, he owns a tech startup and keeps himself busy with his company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</span></p><p><span>Recalling the post-kidnapping experience Danny said, he kept looking over his shoulder constantly and refused to leave his room for quite some time. But thankfully, his friends and family were there to reassure him that he was safe. “I had to talk to Red Cross people, they counseled me, and I reached out to my friends,” he said.</span></p><p><span>He even took help from his college professors. “My professors even, they helped me a lot and got me through it. It’s very important to talk to some people you trust,” he added.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Meng Age</b></h3><p><span>Danny Meng was 36 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>This means he was 26 when he got kidnapped after the tragic Annual Boston Marathon.</span></p><h3><b>Danny Meng Job Details</b></h3><p><span>Danny Meng is the founder of </span><i><span>PleaShare LLC</span></i><span>. He opened the company with his partner in February 2012.</span></p><p><span>Also, Danny is the co-founder of </span><i><span>GoGoCart</span></i><span>, a platform to build websites and sell Asian Grocery Online.</span></p><p><span>Besides this, Danny now is also a reality star, thanks to his time on </span><i><span>American Manhunt: Boston Marathon Bombing</span></i><span>. But even before this, Danny had the pressure of walking the red carpet at </span><i><span>Patriots Day</span></i><span>’s Boston premiere in December 2016 for he was portrayed in the show by Jimmy O. Yang.</span></p><p><span>Back then, in an interview, he said that it was very difficult to describe the deep feelings in his heart in a foreign language. “I was really scared at that moment. I was shaking. My body was shaking for the first ten minutes. I can’t manage to drive. It was the most horrifying moment in my life,” he tried to explain.</span></p><p><span>The only reason Danny ever agreed to share his story was he felt like he had “a responsibility to tell the true story, the way it really happened.”</span></p><h3><b>Is Danny Meng Married?</b></h3><p><span>Danny Meng didn’t reveal his relationship status in 2023. So, we don’t know if he’s married or still enjoying the dating game.</span></p><p><span>His only known partner then was Yinglin Yang. However, she might only be his business partner. The two have known each other since high school from the time they were working on developing and marketing a Chinese food delivery app.</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to Feb 2012, the duo then registered </span><i><span>Pleashare, Inc</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Yinglin left the company in September 2014 and went on a solo venture as the director and curator of</span><i><span> Yve YANG Gallery</span></i><span>. Now, her gallery presents emerging and newly established artists from all over the world.</span></p><p><span>Prior to </span><i><span>Pleashare</span></i><span>, Yinglin co-founded </span><i><span>Upgrade Journey LLC</span></i><span> and worked in product development at </span><i><span>NeuBuild</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Find Yinglin Yang on FB @</span><a href=#><span>yve.yang.1122</span></a></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Danny Meng Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>&nbsp;Danny receives his birthday wishes on June 1 and is of the Gemini zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Danny Meng From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Danny hails from China.
