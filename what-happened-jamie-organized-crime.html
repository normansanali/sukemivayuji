We have the answer below.</p><p>Law & Order: Organized Crime is the sixth spin-off in the Law & Order franchise. It follows Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) as he returns to the NYPD to battle organized crime after his wife’s murder. The series first premiered in 2021 and is currently on its fourth season. Rounding out the cast is Danielle Moné Truitt as Sargeant Ayanna Bell, Ainsley Seiger as Detective Jet Slootmaekers and Rick Gonzalez as Detective Bobby Reyes.</p><p>During the Season 3 finale, the squad lost a beloved member of their team: Detective Jamie Whelan (played by Brent Antonello). The Season 4 premiere picked up a few months after his death and showed several characters struggling to cope with the tragedy. Stabler, who served as a mentor for Whelan, was clearly hurting but masked his pain by diving into another operation. At one point in the episode, Bell told him: “There’s a lot more healing you need to do yourself, in more ways than one.” Jet, who was romantically involved with Whelan, and Reyes, the late detective’s partner, channeled their grief into a different outlet — more on that below.</p><p>Keep reading for a refresher on what occurred in the Season 3 finale, as well as more details on what happened to Jamie Whelan.</p><h2><span>What happened to Jamie Whelan on Law & Order: Organized Crime?</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1256217763.jpg alt="Jamie Whelan" width=1049 height=699 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>What happened to Jamie Whelan? In the Season 3 finale of Law & Order: Organized Crime, Whelan and his partner Reyes were tracking down Kyle Wilkie, the mastermind behind a crime-for-hire website, when a shootout occurred. Whelan was shot by Kyle in the neck before the perp injured himself. When paramedics arrived, Whelan insisted they work on Kyle first, as they needed him alive to take down the website.&nbsp;</span></p><p>After Whelan was rushed to the hospital, viewers learn that the bullet severed his spine. Unable to move his body and needing a device to breathe, Whelan asked his partner to turn of his machine and end his life, but Reyes declined. Whelan and Jet, who had a romance brewing, had one last tearful phone call, in which Jet tells Whelan that she loves him. The detective then received a visit from his father, who presumably turned off his breathing machine, as Whelan flatlined shortly after.</p><p>In the Season 4 premiere, we learn that the Organized Crime squad was very affected by his death and each member is dealing with their grief in a different way. Reyes, Jet and Whelan were a close trio prior to the latter’s death, and now, Reyes and Jet have begun sleeping together. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a>, Ainsley Seiger discussed her character’s grieving process.</p><p>“Grief is a funny thing and it makes you do really weird, crazy stuff. And I think to go from this trio of friends to suddenly a very lonely duo is jarring and odd and really uncomfortable,” Seiger explained. “And I think there’s a lot to be said for the way that a relationship can deepen and develop when the context changes and especially when you’re seeking out someone who knows what you’ve been through.” She continued, “That’s equally what’s hurting [Jet], is that this connection comes with so much stress and so much moral ambiguity … And I don’t think it’s as healing as either of them think that it may be.”</p><p>Ahead of the Season 4 premiere, Danielle Moné Truitt, who stars as Sargeant Ayanna Bell, spoke about how her team was doing following Whelan’s death. “None of them are coping very well,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Insider</a>.&nbsp;“We all loved Detective Whelan. We have become a family and a team, so it’s a lot to have to deal with his loss. Reyes is very angry. He didn’t want anything to change. Jamie’s desk is still empty. Nobody can sit at it. Jet is trying to act like she’s okay, but she’s not. She’s holding all her emotions close to the vest. And Stabler just ran off and did an undercover job so he didn’t have to deal with anything. The way Bell copes is through problem-solving. So she’s bringing in an AI expert to use AI technology to help us do policing in a better way and see if that works.”</p><p>While Reyes may not want anyone to replace his late partner, there are plenty qualified detectives who could take over Whelan’s desk. Fans would love to see Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) or Detective Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters) from SVU return to the franchise. Several former detectives from Chicago P.D., Dick Wolf’s other hit police show, would also make a great addition, such as Detective Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda) or Detective Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer). In the meantime, fans will have tune into Season 4 to see who Whelan’s replacement will be.</p><p>Law & Order: Organized Crime airs on NBC on Thursdays at 10 pm EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWp9dn2OsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWalrqqsYyoqaCZnp7HprCMnKmipZVk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./137974-xxxtentacion-has-reportedly-been-shot-found-without-a-pulse-news.html>&#171;&nbsp;XXXTentacion Has Reportedly Been Shot, Found &amp;quot;Without A Pulse&amp;quot;</a>
