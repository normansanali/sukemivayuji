Ziegler has also received media attention for her love partnerships throughout the years.</strong></p><h2><span id=Maddie_Ziegler_and_Kenneth_San_Jose8217s_Relationship_They_Date>Maddie Ziegler and Kenneth San Jose’s Relationship They Date?</span></h2><p>At the age of 14, Ziegler, a 17-year-old television personality, began seeing her first boyfriend, Kenneth San Jose. In 2016, they met on the set of Lifetime’s Dance Mom and quickly became good friends.</p><p>Fans speculated that Ziegler and San Jose were more than simply buddies due to their developing closeness. Furthermore, their admirers were persuaded that they were dating after Ziegler posted a photo of Jose on Instagram with the message “missed him” on August 19, 2016. Here’s the link to the post:</p><p>Meanwhile, Mackenzie Ziegler, Maddie’s younger sister, remarked “OTP” (one true pair) on the image, implying that Maddie and San Jose were dating.</p><p>The supposed pair, however, never addressed their romance myth, and it evaporated into thin air. Nonetheless, Ziegler’s supporters see San Jose as her first lover.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Between_Ziegler_and_Instagram_Star_Jack_Kelly>Relationship Between Ziegler and Instagram Star Jack Kelly</span></h2><p>Maddie Ziegler’s most well-known romance was with Instagram sensation Jack Kelly. They started dating on January 1, 2017. The couple was candid about their relationship with their admirers.</p><p>Ziegler and Kelly spent a lot of time together and were regularly seen together in public. Furthermore, the pair continued to share images from their romantic outings and travels with their supporters.</p><h2><span id=Maddie_Ziegler_met_Jack_Kelly_when_and_where>Maddie Ziegler met Jack Kelly when and where?</span></h2><p>Ziegler was interviewed by Galore in September 2017, months after he and Kelly began their amorous adventure. During the conversation, the Dance Mom actress stated that she and her then-boyfriend met in Los Angeles six years ago (in 2011).</p><p>She then stated:</p><p>“We met when we were like eight, and then years later we met again, and he’s from Australia, so it was kind of funny — and now we’re just dating”</p><p>Ziegler and Kelly celebrated their first anniversary in Jack’s home country of Australia in January 2018. They celebrated their anniversary with a beach excursion, which the reality star also shared in since-deleted Instagram images.</p><h2><span id=What_Caused_the_Couple8217s_Breakup>What Caused the Couple’s Breakup?</span></h2><p>Ziegler and Kelly dated for around a year and a half before splitting up in August 2018. The couple did not publicly announce their breakup, but a close acquaintance of the ex-couple confirmed it to Confidential. According to the insider, the couple split up owing to their demanding work schedule.</p><p>“They still talk and there has not been a defining reason behind it, just that it’s becoming more difficult to maintain the relationship between the distance and both their schedules,” the insider was quoted as saying.</p><p>In 2018, Maddie dated Kailand Morris.</p><p>Maddie was unmarried for over a year after her separation from Jack Kelly. In mid-2018, she began dating Kailand Morris, the son of American artist Stevie Wonder. Maddie and Morris began dating in October 2018, according to People.</p><p>People spoke with Ziegler’s spokesperson, who verified their relationship. The Blast previously stated that they were dating. The proof came weeks later when they were sighted having fun at Disneyland with two other buddies.</p><p>According to The Blast, the pair originally met backstage at Dancing with the Stars: Junior, where both of their younger siblings, Mackenzie Ziegler and Mandla Morris, were competing.</p><p>In addition, Mackenzie is presently dating actor Isaak Presley.</p><p>Ziegler and Morris also appeared in photographer Tyler Shields’ picture series in January 2019. They dated for a few more months and continued to post images of themselves on social media. After a while, however, they both stopped sharing one other’s images. They didn’t announce their breakup, yet their romance terminated prematurely.</p><h2><span id=In_2020_who_is_Maddie_Ziegler_dating>In 2020, who is Maddie Ziegler dating?</span></h2><p>Eddie Benjamin is Ziegler’s current boyfriend. They began dating in 2019, not long after Ziegler broke her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Morris. The 17-year-old American dancer is madly in love with her lover, an Australian artist.</p><p>According to insiders, the pair even lives together and spends the majority of their time together at the home of Australian musician Sia.</p><p>Ziegler and Benjamin first met in 2019, and they subsequently worked on a little song called Lullaby, which artist Sia later shared on her YouTube channel.</p><p>Their cooperation for the 32-second song pushed them closer together, and they began dating officially a few weeks later.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag>DANCER</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Model</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Dominic Seagal | Parents And Net Worth</a></h3>The American actor Steven Seagal and Kelly LeBrock are the parents of Dominic Seagal.
