However, in recent years, his career in the UFC took a downward spiral, leading to his departure from the organization. This article explores the reasons behind Tyron Woodley's departure from the UFC and examines the factors that contributed to his decline.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Rise of Tyron Woodley</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tyron Woodley burst onto the UFC scene in 2013 with an impressive knockout victory over Jay Hieron. He quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with in the welterweight division, amassing an impressive record and capturing the championship belt in 2016 by defeating Robbie Lawler.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Stagnation and Lack of Activity</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the key factors that led to Woodley's departure from the UFC was his lack of activity and stagnation in the later stages of his career. After winning the championship, Woodley defended his title successfully on multiple occasions but failed to maintain an active fighting schedule.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Woodley's infrequent appearances in the Octagon frustrated UFC fans and officials alike. The lack of regular fights not only affected his popularity but also limited his opportunities to showcase his skills and prove himself as a dominant champion.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Criticisms of Woodley's Fighting Style</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another factor that contributed to Woodley's departure was the criticism surrounding his fighting style. While Woodley possessed incredible knockout power and athleticism, many criticized his cautious approach and defensive style of fighting.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Woodley was often accused of being too defensive and not taking enough risks in his fights. This led to some lackluster performances and less exciting fights, which affected his appeal to both fans and the UFC management.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Personality Clashes with the UFC</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to his fighting style, Woodley's personality clashes with the UFC management further strained his relationship with the organization. Woodley was known for being outspoken and unafraid to voice his opinions, which sometimes led to conflicts with UFC President Dana White.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Woodley's criticisms of the UFC's treatment of athletes and issues of pay disparity within the organization didn't sit well with the UFC brass. These disagreements and clashes in ideologies created a rift between Woodley and the UFC, further contributing to his departure.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Inability to Adapt and Evolve</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the sport of mixed martial arts evolves, fighters must also adapt and evolve their skills to stay competitive. Woodley's inability to adapt his fighting style and develop new techniques became apparent as he faced younger and more versatile opponents.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Woodley struggled to implement a diverse range of skills, often relying heavily on his wrestling background and knockout power. This limited approach made it easier for opponents to strategize against him, leading to losses and a decline in his overall performance.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Decline in Performance and Loss of Championship</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Woodley's decline in performance and the loss of his championship title were significant factors that ultimately led to his departure from the UFC. After a successful title defense against Darren Till in 2018, Woodley suffered three consecutive losses against Kamaru Usman, Gilbert Burns, and Colby Covington.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>These losses showcased Woodley's struggles to adapt to the changing landscape of the welterweight division and raised doubts about his ability to remain competitive at the highest level. The decline in his performance and the loss of his championship belt diminished his marketability and made his departure from the UFC inevitable.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tyron Woodley's departure from the UFC can be attributed to a combination of factors. His lack of activity, criticism of his fighting style, clashes with the UFC management, inability to adapt, and decline in performance all played a role in his exit from the organization.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Woodley's departure marked the end of his UFC career, it doesn't diminish his accomplishments and contributions to the sport. Woodley will always be remembered as a former welterweight champion and one of the most dominant fighters in the division during his prime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn7JllJ6xbsDYq6anZaekvKW4xLJkpZ2Rq7JuwcWc</p></div><div id=links><a href=./scandal-refresher-the-first-half-of-season-5-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;A Scandal Refresher: Every Last Thing to Remember From the First Half of Season 5</a>
