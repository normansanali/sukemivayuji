She used to date a guy who constantly complained about her driver’s work and bragged about it. This angered Jessica and made her pay attention to driving the transport truck.</p><p>Finally, in 2012, when the <strong>Shipping Wars</strong> started as a reality show, she joined the team and started driving. This 170 cm brave lady in A&E reality started shooting on January 10 when they were working in the 6th season. In addition, the show began airing in April 2015 after seven seasons.

Her fantastic display of women’s power and abilities under challenging environments is impressive. Unfortunately, since the cancellation in 2015, this situation did not continue. This makes fans wonder where some of their favorite stars have gone, <a href=#>including Samko</a>. Let’s find out.</p><p>Even after the show ended, she continued her truck business. According to her LinkedIn resume, Jessica is still a truck driver and likes to do it even today. So far, Jessica is driving a 2008 Volvo 780 truck. It is also related to companies like Landsat, which provides delivery services in North America. She is currently operating under the name of JMS Transport which is own by her husband. Samko lives in Jew Jersey with her beloved.</p><h2>Jessica Samko Net Worth</h2><p>Jessica Samko collected a lot of wealth in her career as a reality show celebrity. Her estimated income is approximately <strong>US$500,000</strong> at the beginning of 2021. In addition, by season 7, she can earn about $1,000 per episode of A&E Shipping Wars.

Similarly, Samko’s photos and captions in the Facebook account are loved by her fans. But she is not active on Instagram. It looks like Jessica loves her life private.</p><h2>Last Word</h2><p>The so-called men’s world of “Truck driving” is now lead by the bold and brave lady. All thanks to this Samko girl.
