ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it’s unclear how exactly these two became such close pals, the Friends star, who has made countless appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live over the years, has been very open about her friendship with the 52-year-old, even admitting that she invites him and his wife, Molly McNearney, to her annual Friendsgiving dinner.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, Kimmel and Aniston have even organized <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charitable donations to people in need</a> during the coronavirus pandemic,&nbsp;which quite frankly screams ultimate BFF goals to us.</p><p>The pair, who also share mutual friends Adam Sandler, Ellen Degeneres, and Courteney Cox, has never been shy to talk about their fun-filled moments together, and even though it’s unknown how exactly they became BFFs, considering how they run into each other at every other Hollywood event, they were bound to form some sort of bond.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-and-jennifer-aniston-s-friendship>Jimmy Kimmel And Jennifer Aniston’s Friendship</h2><p>Over the summer of 2014, Kimmel managed to arrange a Friends mini-reunion on his show thanks to his close ties with Aniston,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who also took part in the skit</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston, alongside Cox and Lisa Kudrow, pretended to be confused and agitated by Kimmel’s fan fiction, which was entered around Ross - played by the talk show host - making love to Rachel in an interesting table read.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Why Jennifer Aniston Turned Down Saturday Night Live</a></span></p><p>While the skit was a huge hit, amassing over 34 million views on YouTube, some fans were left wondering whether the awkwardness between the Friends cast and Kimmel was real, with many viewers leaving concerned remarks in the comment section.</p><p>One person wrote: “Last year Kimmel had cruel and immoral parents lie to their kids about eating their Halloween candy and watching them cry. Now he tricks Jennifer Aniston into a ‘Friends’ reunion-like situation, She’s obviously not happy about it. Conclusion: Kimmel’s not exactly a good person.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kimmel took to his show the following day to clear up the misunderstanding of what was supposed to be a comedy segment, insisting that Kudrow, Cox, and Aniston were well aware of the script before filming took place.</p><p>“We were clearly acting, right?” Kimmel addressed his studio audience. “For some reason, maybe half, if not more of the people commenting online, seem to think that was real. I’m not kidding.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Where Jennifer Aniston Was Working Right Before She Got The ‘Friends’ Pilot</a></span></p><p>“She was acting. Apparently very well, too. She should probably get an Emmy,” he continued.</p><p>“I’m puzzled by this, I have to say. It’s weird. 99 percent of the time you put something on YouTube, everyone jumps in to say its fake. Then we put something that is — I thought — obviously fake, and people think it’s real.”</p><p>To those who were wondering whether the skit was real, the father-of-four added that he’s been friends with Aniston for years and she was totally in on the joke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Kimmel joked that he became jealous of Aniston’s appearance on a talk show by another “Jimmy,” referring to Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show.</p><p>Aniston frequently goes on vacation with Kimmel and his wife, whom she has even enjoyed girls’ trips out of the country with, which has provided plenty of good content for the popular TV personalities to talk about during their televised interviews.</p><p>At the 2020 Emmy Awards, Aniston and Kimmel presented an award together; the same week they also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donated a $10,000 Postmates gift card</a> to a cardiovascular nurse named Kimball Fairbanks. It was revealed that the Utah native had been tested positive for the coronavirus, so the gesture was certainly appreciated by the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Jimmy Kimmel Really Thinks About His Former Comedy Partner Adam Carolla</a></span></p><p>In a video call on his ABC show, Aniston joined Fairbanks to share the joyful news of her win as Kimmel started by saying: “We wanted to cheer you up a little bit, so I'd like you to meet somebody. Her name is Jennifer.”</p><p>Aniston had chimed in: “I just have to say, God bless you and all of you that are out there doing what you're doing.”</p><p>They also sent gift cards to Fairbanks’ coworkers who had been affected by the pandemic.</p><p>After the surprise, Aniston told Kimmel how happy she was to still be in close contact with her pal amid the growing spread of the coronavirus which had left Brad Pitt’s ex-wife staying firm in lockdown at her Los Angeles mansion.</p><p>“I'm so happy to be with you...
