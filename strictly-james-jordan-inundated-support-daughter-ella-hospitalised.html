with an IV drip and a small tear running down her face. James was so proud of his young girl, as he shared: "My little warrior!! We are still at Pembury Hospital but she has finally turned a corner after 5 days and long nights of fighting an extremely high temperature."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Relive with Ella Jordan met Father Christmas</figure><p id=eUF82HLGqr data-wc=64>Explaining what happened, the 45-year-old shared: "It started Monday but on Wednesday night things got pretty bad and temperature was 40+ so took her to A and E at roughly midnight where a doctor gave her a quick look over and said it was a viral infection and told us to continue with Calpol/Ibrofen and take her home and it would take its course.</p><p id=eZa7zQpI4H data-wc=110>"I did try to say it seems more like a chest infection than a viral infection but I'm not the expert. He also told us that it wasn't because he had listened to her chest. After getting her home we kept a log of every time we gave her Calpol and then Ibuprofen (2 hours apart) alternating. After 2 more terrible nights of her temperature staying around 39 - 40 and her throwing up several times in her sleep. And even though we felt we were maybe wasting the doctors and nurses time and would look like overprotective parents - we decided to take her back to A and E."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc6c77d5c324-snapinstaapp410021652183984947350548156061496204193447143n1080.jpg><p id=e4NP6B1fdS data-wc=75>James continued: "WELL!!! What a totally different experience - we were met by caring and fun nurses who were 100% attentive and by a doctor that was so thorough and taking nothing to chance. Ella clearly looked not well and was sent straight to X-Ray - and almost immediately had bloods taken by a totally amazing team of nurses, who I thank massively. <strong>The results came back as her having a chest infection and tonsillitis.</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ejzW0-dDUm data-wc=24>"They have now had to put her on an IV for the antibiotics because she's been ill for so long and now very ill."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ab887eebc74-snapinstaapp409916991183984947590548155529445815335145190n1080.jpg><p id=ehLYdeJPOH data-wc=59>Finishing off, he concluded: "<strong>Anyway, the moral of the story is - go with your gut parents.&nbsp;</strong>We knew it was something more serious. I'm just angry with myself I didn't push harder. But to be honest I didn’t want to be a [expletive] to them. It's just a shame sometimes you have to because of some people’s incompetence.</p><p id=eZzAYD_0fH data-wc=52>"Then on the flip side, today we experienced the opposite end of the spectrum by sheer brilliance from a wonderful team of people. This post might go down like a lead balloon for me to even dare say anything negative about the NHS. But I will do anything for my baby girl."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee0c2c527e17-jordan-family.jpg><p id=eKQoxTatdF data-wc=55>James was immediately supported by his fans, with <a class=hm-link href=#>Coleen Nolan</a> saying: "Ahh thinking of you all.. so scary when it's your kids.
