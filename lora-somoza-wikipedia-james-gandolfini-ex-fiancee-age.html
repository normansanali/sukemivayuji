No, it was not The Sopranos star who confirmed the news but The Sun that exclusively reported:</p><p>“‘IT WAS HORRIBLE’ Sopranos star James Gandolfini’s ex-fiancee Lora Somoza ‘was found dead in mom’s swimming pool’ in freak accident at 51”</p><p style=text-align:left>Now, as we pray for the departed soul, let’s also remember who&nbsp;Lora Somoza was, what was her relationship like with James Gandolfini, and more in this Lora Somoza Wikipedia.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lora Somoza Accident</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>So, The Sun, PageSix, and others have reported, Lora Somoza died in a “terrible accident” last year when she slipped, hit her head, and fell into a swimming pool in Los Angeles. She was at her mother Candace’s.</p><p style=text-align:left>Lora’s astrologist/pal Zoe Moon told The Sun that it was Lora’s mother who found her. “It was horrible, a terrible accident.”</p><p style=text-align:left>The day on the calendar had marked 5 July 2020 when beautiful, ageless Lora breathe her last air.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is There An Obituary For Lora Somoza?</strong></h3><p>No, there doesn’t seem to be an official obituary for Lora.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lora Somoza And James Gandolfini’s Relationship</strong></h3><p>Lora Somoza was engaged to James Gandolfini from 2003 until 2005 and had called it off when she&nbsp;Somoza moved away to care for her grandmother, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p style=text-align:left>They met in 2000 when Lora was an assistant to the director on the set of James’s film The Me</p><p>Lora’s Astrologist, who collaborated on podcasts and radio shows with Lora, also discussed how “madly and insanely in love, Lora and James were when they were together. “It was like a soulmate kind of thing.”</p><p>She said, what happened to Lora’s relationship with James was such a sad thing because they were both so in love with each other even at the end of their relationship.</p><p>“…even when they broke up, they were still in love with each other. They just couldn’t get past a few things. What they wanted going forward as a team was not the same thing, that’s really what broke them up.”</p><p>Zoe, who closely witnessed their affair, now regrets as both Lora and James had a very short life after they broke, she wishes, they could have found a way to stay together.</p><p>“As wild as she seemed on the outside, I think Lora was very grounding for James. She never stopped seeing him as the love of her life and never stopped loving him.”</p><p style=text-align:left>James, when he died unexpectedly in Rome on June 19, 2013, he had been married to former model Deborah Lin for four years.</p><p>Known for his three Emmy, Screen Actors Guild, and Golden Globe award-winning performance of Tony Soprano, the Italian-American crime boss in HBO’s The Sopranos, James was expected to travel to Sicily a few days later to receive an award at the Taormina Film Fest; when his 14-year-old son Michael discovered him unconscious on the bathroom floor at the Boscolo Exedra Hotel.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Old Was Lora Somoza?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lora Somoza was 51 when she died — the same age at which her ex.

That was just mind-boggling and really, really difficult for Lora.”</p><p>Shortly before her death, the Sun reported, she posted a photo of herself with Gandolfini and wrote: “It’s been 7 years. You will always be loved and missed. #love #missyou #rip.”</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lora Somoza Job</strong></h3><p>Again, in Zoe’s words, “Very ambitious and very driven” Lora Somoza had been working on a show idea when she passed away.</p><p>After her breakup with James, Lora pursued a career as a sex therapist, columnist and launched the podcast “Between the Sheets with Lora Somoza.”</p><p>Zoe said, Lora besides being beautiful, had a great sense of humor, was incredibly smart, and very witty.
