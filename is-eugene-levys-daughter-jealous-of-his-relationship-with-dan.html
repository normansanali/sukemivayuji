Thankfully for everyone involved with the show’s production and all of its fans, Schitt's Creek began to pick up steam once it began streaming on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. From there, not only did Schitt's Creek become a massive hit with fans, the sitcom became one of the most acclaimed series on television during its final couple of seasons.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Overjoyed That The Emmy-Winning Show 'Schitt’s Creek' Released Early On Netflix</a></span>Once Schitt's Creek became a sensation, a lot of attention was paid to <a href=#>Dan Levy and Eugene Levy’s relationship</a>. Of course, that makes a lot of sense since the father and son acting duo were great onscreen together and they co-created Schitt’s Creek. On the other hand, a lot of people didn’t seem to know that another member of the Levy family starred in Schitt’s Creek since Sarah Levy brought Twyla Sands to life. Since she was a big part of the show and so much attention was paid to her brother and father, some people wonder if Sarah is jealous of Eugene Levy’s relationship with Dan Levy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-the-levy-family>Who Are The Levy Family?</h2><p>Over the last several years, it has become pretty clear that a lot of people throw around the word legend far too freely. However, even though Eugene Levy has never been the kind of star that headlines blockbuster movies, there is little doubt that he is a comedy legend. First introduced to the world due to his role starring in the sketch comedy series SCTV, Eugene also worked as a writer on the popular show. In the years since that show came to an end, Eugene has gone on to star in endless movies including the American Pie series and Christopher Guest’s various mockumentaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the people closest to her have become famous, <a href=#>little is known about the Levy family matriarch Deborah Divine</a>. One thing that is very clear about Divine though is that she is very proud of her family and before she closed her Twitter account, she was an outspoken supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dan Levy Had An Extensive Career As A TV Host Before 'Schitt's Creek'</a></span></p><p>In the years since Schitt’s Creek debuted on television, Dan Levy has become one of the most successful voices of his generation in Hollywood. Best known for starring in, co-creating, and working as the showrunner for Schitt’s Creek, Dan has also begun to branch out. Set to be the creative force behind many upcoming projects, Dan also became a movie star thanks to his role in Happiest Season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A decade before Schitt’s Creek premiered on television, Sarah Levy made her screen debut with a small part in the movie Cheaper by the Dozen 2. In the years that followed that initial role, Sarah popped up in the movie Larry Crowne and a few mostly unnoticed projects. Now that Sarah has proven how wonderful she was as a part of Schitt’s Creek core cast, fans everywhere hope that her career will only go up from here.</p><h2 id=is-sarah-levy-jealous-of-eugene-levy-and-dan-levy-rsquo-s-relationship>Is Sarah Levy Jealous Of Eugene Levy And Dan Levy’s Relationship?</h2><p>In an ideal world, every parent with multiple kids would have an equal bond with all of their children. In reality, however, the truth of the matter is that most parents in that situation wind up having a little bit more of a bond with one child above the rest for a variety of reasons. Of course, that isn’t to say that parents with a favorite kid love their other children any less. Instead, it is just an acceptance of the reality of human relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Hilarious Times These Celebrities' Kids Outshined Their Parents</a></span></p><p>Of course, it should go without saying that making assumptions about the Levy family from the outside looking in would be ridiculous. That said, anyone with a basic understanding of people will know that there is a good chance that Eugene Levy and Dan Levy have an incredibly close bond. After all, there aren’t too many people who know what it is like to co-create and star in a hit show. Since Dan and Eugene did that together, having that in common almost certainly brought them closer together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the assumptions that can be made about Dan Levy and Eugene Levy’s relationship, there is absolutely no indication that Sarah Levy feels like someone on the outside looking in. On the contrary, when Sarah has spoken about her brother and father, it has seemed very clear that she adores them both and in at least one way, she is glad to not be in their position. After all, when she spoke to Flare in 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah stated that she was relieved to not be wrapped up in the attention Dan and Eugene receive as a pair</a>.</p><p>“When the show first came out, everyone assumed I was the sister. I love that that wasn’t the case because it has fully removed me from the hubbub of Daniel and Dad being father and son onscreen. I loved that people didn’t know that I was related in any way, because I was able to do my own thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of what Sarah Levy has said about not envying the attention that her father and brother receive together, something that Dan Levy once revealed made it clear she has no reason to be jealous. After all, when Dan appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and talked about his sister’s 2021 wedding, it became clear that both of Sarah’s parents care deeply about her. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eugene and Deborah Divine worked out a duet and surprised Sarah by performing at her wedding</a> reception. Since some parents are reluctant to even speak at their child’s wedding, that says a lot.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Schitt's Creek Cast: Current Ages, Relationship Statuses, & Net Worths</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWVqrSmusRmo56uqah6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJit6aty6isrGWfm3qptdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaeewal5w5qlaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-miley-cyrus-dating-fletcher-rumors-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Miley Cyrus Dating Fletcher?
