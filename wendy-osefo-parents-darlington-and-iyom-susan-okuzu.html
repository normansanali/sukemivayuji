So, she turned 65 years old in 2023.</p><p>On last year’s Mother’s Day, Wendy took to her social media to confess to her mommy and sister that there is no her without them. “Thank you for everything you sacrificed, every smile you put on my face, every word of affirmation, every hug. You two are the definition of not only motherhood but love. Happy Mother’s Day!!”, she further added next to pictures of all three of them together.</p><p>Wendy’s mom can be found on her IG <a href=#>@iyomokuzu</a>&nbsp;and on ‘Iyom Susan Okuzu’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>.</p><p>Lately, amid a “false” attack on Wendy and her family, Wendy’s mother has been particularly backed by RHOP fans. This happened after Ashley Darby, who is also from Nigeria, accused her co-star Wendy of being from the “cursed” Osu tribe. Fans especially detected the fact that Ashley brought up Wendy’s mom.</p><p>An in-law of Wendy Osefo dished about Wendy’s family being the Western equivalent of the “wrong side of the tracks.” She said her family and their ancestors have had bad reputations because of evils stemming from past generations, and are essentially cursed. Of course, Wendy denied these claims.</p><p>Last year, there was a similar heaviness in the Real Housewives air when Wendy and her mom, who inspired her new memoir, Tears of My Mother, had spat with Mia Thornton.</p><h3><strong>Meet Darlington Okuzu, </strong><strong>Wendy Osefo’s Father</strong></h3><p>Wendy Osefo’s father Darlington Okuzu who was reportedly born in January 1954 is no more.

Wendy’s mom continued to mention her relationship status as ‘widowed’ even at the time of this writing.</p><p>“My parents came to this country with nothing. My dad worked at a fast food restaurant and one day he found out that he was being promoted to manager,” Wendy recalled on The Real Housewives of Potomac’s November 8, 2023, episode. “He was so happy that to thank this country for giving him the opportunity to be a manager, he named his second daughter after that restaurant: Wendy.”</p><p>She added, “I am literally the embodiment of the American dream.”</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Did Wendy Osefo’s Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Wendy Osefo’s parents gave birth to two more kids, a son and a daughter. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Jordan Okuzu can be found on IG <a href=#>@kevlarjenner</a>. On his LinkedIn, he mentioned working as a video editor/director and recording artist at ANDA Records LLC&nbsp;since February 2021. Also, it appears, he is supposed to get his bachelor’s degree in cinematography and film/video production from Temple University in May 2024. Not to miss, Jordan also appeared in an episode of&nbsp;RHOP&nbsp;in 2022.</p><p>The other is Yvonne Umezurike Ozuzu. She turned 42 years old in May 2023.

As of 2023 though, she had been residing in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>About her parents, Wendy once said they came to the United States with nothing. She further explained that her dad worked at a fast-food restaurant and one day he found out that he was being promoted to manager. So, Wendy said, he was so happy that to thank this country for giving him the opportunity to be a manager, he named Wendy after that restaurant.</p><p>It is “exquisitely drawn” in a book called&nbsp;Mother Daughter Me&nbsp;that&nbsp;Wendy’s mother arrived in the United States from Nigeria with two things: a single suitcase and the fierce determination to make a better life for herself and her future family. Indeed, it is also described that she succeeded by starting by working in a fast-food restaurant and ultimately becoming the director of nursing at a major metropolitan hospital. This book details the intense bond that Wendy has with her mother and explores how her Nigerian upbringing affected her life, success, and role as a parent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmsJ2emcZuu9KenahloJa%2FprrTrGSdmaKhtq%2Bz06ilZpmemXqqxc6mZKyto5a7brvKrrGuZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./deion-sanders-jr.html>&#171;&nbsp;Deion Sanders Jr.</a>
