style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>What happened to Doughboy on Street Outlaws Memphis?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>When Street Outlaws premiered on the Discovery channel back in 2013, it instantly became a hit with auto racing fans across the US—and eventually, across the planet.</p><p>The show follows competitors from Oklahoma City—where the show started—as well as Detroit, Memphis, New Orleans, St. Louis, and several Texas street racing hot spots.</p><p>With nine regular seasons, No Prep Kings, a video game, and the Fastest in America spin-off shows, Street Outlaws has had a long time to win hearts worldwide.</p><p>And as the drivers of the cast put the pedal to the metal to represent their crew, many of them gained a major fan following.</p><p>It may have started with the OKC icons like Big Chief and Daddy Dave, but soon the Memphis crew was seeing a lot of love.</p><h2><strong>Who are the stars of Street Outlaws Memphis?</strong></h2><p>As the team’s official leader, <a href=#>JJ Da Boss</a> soon became a favorite with his brutal honesty and ruthlessness on the streets.</p><p>He may be a big name in Memphis street racing, but <a href=#>JJ</a> is a family man as well—he’s got 11 kids and a few grandkids so far.</p><p>As a loyal teammate, good friend, and expert mentor to many on the street circuit, it’s no wonder he’s gained a major fan base.</p><p>The tenacious little pocket rocket known as <a href=#>Precious Cooper</a>, who came up in the ninth season of the show and quickly clocked up some solid wins on the circuit, is also impressing Discovery channel viewers.</p><p>&nbsp;Then there’s <a href=#>JJ Da Boss’s wife</a> <a href=#>Tricia “Midget” Day</a>, who grew up with Precious Cooper and holds her own going head-to-head against some of the best street racers in Tennessee.</p><p>Even with a bunch of kids at home, she still finds time to dominate in her ’66 Chevy Nova.</p><p>Another racer that caught viewers’ attention early on in his reality television career was Doughboy.</p><p>Doughboy rose through the ranks with the Memphis crew and earned a reputation as a skilled driver, competitive racer, and all-around badass on the streets.</p><p>Then he disappeared from the show. He stopped updating his social media.</p><p>Fans want to know: what happened to Doughboy on Street Outlaws? Here’s the answer.</p><h2><strong>Who is Doughboy on Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy is the son of Street Outlaws Memphis big boss man, Jonathan Day—AKA JJ Da Boss.</p><p>And no, Tricia “Midget” Day is not his mom—JJ’s wife is actually 10 years younger than he is, and was only 7 years old when JJ welcomed his first child with someone else.</p><p>Doughboy was born on December 31, 1990, in his dad’s hometown outside Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>He is the oldest of JJ’s 11 children, and his real name is Joshua Day.</p><p>He married his wife, fellow street racer Chelsea, in September of 2015, and the pair have two children—a son named Kamden and a daughter named Novaleigh.</p><p>Doughboy first appeared on Street Outlaws: Memphis in only its second episode, and he rapidly amassed some die-hard fans.</p><p>In mid-2021, those fans noticed that Doughboy wasn’t on the show anymore.</p><p>Tracking his social media, it appeared that he hadn’t even posted on Instagram since April of 2019.</p><p>While the show must go on, Doughboy didn’t appear in the next 12 episodes until 2022.</p><h2><strong>What happened to Doughboy from Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy Day’s absence from the hit Discovery show throughout season 5 generated a lot of attention and led to some pretty unhappy viewers.</p><p>The cast, crew, and show producers remained tight-lipped on Doughboy’s whereabouts, leading fans to speculate that something terrible had happened.</p><p>Viewers also drew attention to the fact that in show footage and social media posts by the Street Outlaws: Memphis crew, Doughboy’s wife, Chelsea, and the pair’s two children are often around.</p><p>The trio appear to spend a lot of time at JJ and Tricia’s home—but Doughboy is never in the shots.</p><p>When news surfaced that Chelsea and their children were living with JJ Da Boss and Tricia, fans became even more suspicious.</p><p>Theories were varied—with many fans on Reddit suggesting that Doughboy was possibly in jail following some earlier legal issues. One user set the record straight on that theory, explaining that “<a href=# rel=noopener>you can check the jail records and he’s not in jail</a>.”</p><p>Others thought the legal issues he had previously referred to were following the often circulated Cali fight, in which Doughboy appeared to play a major role. After this, the theory was that Discovery / Pilgrim did not want him on the show.</p><p>Due to contractual obligations, this also meant he could not be shown in any social media channels endorsed by the show—like other cast members’ Instagram feeds, for example.</p><p>As a long-time member of the larger Day family—and Precious Cooper’s sister—Chelsea continues racing and is involved with the rest of the crew.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Albert DePrisco Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Where is Doughboy from Street Outlaws, really?</strong></h2><p>Possibly tiring of all the gossip that detracted from the Street Outlaws: Memphis show—and the racing itself—JJ Da Boss eventually explained in a video excerpt that Doughboy was having back trouble.</p><p>He explained that Doughboy had an injured disk in his back.</p><p>Given that the eldest of the Day children had sustained serious injuries in a car accident back in season 2 of the show, it might make sense that he is currently out of action.</p><p>As if to confirm this, some fans noted that they spotted Doughboy at the end of season 5, episode 7, in the background.</p><p>This has not been confirmed by show execs but it goes a long way to dispelling some of the rumors going around.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is JJ and precious relationship</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is Willy McQuillian’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdp6WctaO72Gamp2Wjqb%2BmsdNmpq6snJbEtHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-really-happened-between-elliot-page-and-emma-portner.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Really Happened Between Elliot Page And Emma Portner?</a>
