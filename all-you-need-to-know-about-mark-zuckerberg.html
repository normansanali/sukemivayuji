Mark Zuckerberg has spent much of the last decade as one of the world’s wealthiest people. Mark is the youngest of the world’s top 100 richest persons.</p><p>He is the youngest among the top 30 by more than a decade. Unsurprisingly, the great majority of Mark’s riches are related to his Facebook shares.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Mark Zuckerberg?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mark Zuckerberg</a> was born in White Plains on May 14, 1984, in New York. Edward, his father, is a dentist, and Karen, his mother, is a psychiatrist. Randi, Donna, and Arielle are his sisters. Mark and his sisters were raised in Dobbs Ferry, Westchester County, New York. When he was 12, he had a “Star Wars” themed Bar Mitzvah.</p><p>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In the 1990s, his father taught him BASIC programming and later hired software engineer David Newman to train him privately.</p><p>Zuckerberg spent his freshman and sophomore years at Ardsley High School. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy for his junior and senior years, where he excelled academically and won medals in physics, arithmetic, astronomy, and classical studies. He was the captain of the fencing squad at Phillip Exeter Academy.</p><p>He took a graduate-level BASIC course at Mercy College while in high school. He also created a software program dubbed “ZuckNet” that connected all of the computers in the Zuckerbergs’ house to those in his father’s dentistry clinic. It functioned similarly to AOL’s Instant Messenger, which debuted the year after Mark created ZuckNet.</p><p>In high school, Zuckerberg also created the Synapse Media Player, a music player. The media player figured out what the user liked to listen to. AOL attempted to acquire Synapse and recruit Zuckerberg. Microsoft also made a proposal for Synapse and attempted to hire Zuckerberg. In the fall of 2002, he did not sell and enrolled at Harvard.</p><p>Mark presently controls over 400 million total shares of Facebook, which are divided into numerous classes with varying voting rights. He owns around 12 million Class A shares of Facebook and 365 million Class B shares, accounting for approximately 81% of all B shares. Mark holds 53% voting power in the corporation thanks to the Class B super-voting shares. Mark technically owns co-founder Dustin Moskovitz’s Class B voting rights, giving him approximately 58% of the company’s overall voting power.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Mark Zuckerberg?</h2><p>He is currently 39 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth?</h2><p>The American technology entrepreneur is estimated to be worth $118 Billion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Mark Zuckerberg’s career?</h2><p>By the time he arrived at Harvard, Zuckerberg had established himself as a programming prodigy. He majored in both psychology and computer science. He was a member of the fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi and the Kirkland House. During his sophomore year, Zuckerberg created the application CourseMatch. Users might form study groups and choose classes depending on the choices of other students. Not long after, he invented Facemash, which allowed users to choose the most attractive person from a series of images. The site flooded Harvard’s servers the first weekend it was up and running, forcing the institution to shut it down.</p><p>In January 2004, Zuckerberg began building code for a new website the following semester. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg, along with friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin, founded “Thefacebook,” originally located at thefacebook.com, from his Harvard dorm room.<br>In his second year, Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard to concentrate on Facebook. In 2017, he was awarded an honorary degree.</p><p>In the spring of 2004, Zuckerberg, Moskovitz, and other pals relocated to Palo Alto, California, and leased a tiny house that acted as Facebook’s workplace. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist who invested in the firm. Originally, the group intended to return to Harvard, but they opted to stay in California. They have already turned down buyout bids from major firms. In April 2009, Zuckerberg sought assistance from former Netscape CFO Peter Currie on Facebook financing techniques.</p><p>On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg announced that the company had achieved 500 million users. Of course, Facebook is now a massive social network that has made Mark Zuckerberg one of the world’s richest men.</p><p>On May 18, 2012, Facebook went public for $38 per share. Mark holds 400 million Facebook shares. That means he had a paper net worth of about $15 billion at the time of the IPO.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg’s annual compensation is one dollar. That is not a mistake. Many executives, including Zuckerberg, chose to pay themselves low wages in order to maximize the company’s revenues. When a corporation optimizes earnings, the overall value of its stock holdings increases, which is where the executive’s true wealth comes from. Executives like Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin are paid under $1 each year!</p><p>Mark has committed to donating 99 percent of his wealth during his lifetime. In September 2017, he announced a proposal to sell pieces of his stock on a monthly basis to fund his organization, the CZI (Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative). His 2018 share sales earned $5.3 billion in revenue. In 2019, he sold $1.86 billion in Facebook stock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqjpWWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWZpibp6Wpeq6t0aRks62ToLKzrsSrnmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./anirudh-pisharody.html>&#171;&nbsp;Anirudh Pisharody Wiki, Biography, Death, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Parents, Wife</a>
