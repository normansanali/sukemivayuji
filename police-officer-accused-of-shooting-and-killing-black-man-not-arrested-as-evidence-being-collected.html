class=mol-para-with-font>Anger is growing in North Carolina after a police officer accused of hitting a black man with his truck before shooting him dead has yet to be arrested because ‘evidence is

after 2.15pm on Saturday, in Fayetteville.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hash was driving in his personal vehicle with his wife and daughter when he claims Walker jumped on his car, tore off his windscreen wipers and began smashing his windshield – later telling a bystander during a 911 call: ‘He jumped on my vehicle. I just had to shoot him.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But&nbsp;Black Lives Matter activists and a trauma nurse who attended to Walker on the scene have suggested that Hash hit the father-of-one – who leaves behind a young son – with his truck and then shot him dead in cold blood, while noted lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the family of George Floyd, branded the incident a ‘case of a shoot first, ask later philosophy’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There have now been three straight nights of protests demanding Hash be arrested – with more planned for this week – as Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin and others plead for demonstrators to remain peaceful. While Hash was taken into custody following the shooting, he was not arrested and has been placed on administrative leave.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It comes after Police Chief Gina Hawkins told<a class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#> CBS 17</a> that initial statements from witnesses, and the physical evidence, including the truck’s black box, do not indicate that Hash hit Walker with his vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Often individuals are not arrested immediately without, with lack of evidence, so right now evidence is being collected by the State Bureau of Investigation to determine that,’ Hawkins said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is now ‘reviewing’ the evidence – including body cam footage – to see if there were any civil rights violations.&nbsp;</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-36237989d0bb5e54 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/05/52826131-10393227-image-a-43_1641966517631.jpg height=542 width=962 alt="Fayetteville Police Chief Gina Hawkins said&nbsp;initial statements from witnesses and physical evidence do not indicate that Hash hit Walker with his vehicle as Black Lives Matter protests continue over the incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-36237989d0bb5e54 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/05/52826131-10393227-image-a-43_1641966517631.jpg height=542 width=962 alt="Fayetteville Police Chief Gina Hawkins said&nbsp;initial statements from witnesses and physical evidence do not indicate that Hash hit Walker with his vehicle as Black Lives Matter protests continue over the incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Fayetteville Police Chief Gina Hawkins said&nbsp;initial statements from witnesses and physical evidence do not indicate that Hash hit Walker with his vehicle as Black Lives Matter protests continue over the incident</p><img decoding=async id=i-31b667059714c5ae src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/06/52794203-10393227-Lieutenant_Jeffrey_Hash_pictured_is_being_detained_and_questione-a-3_1641968499583.jpg height=548 width=470 alt="Lieutenant Jeffrey Hash (pictured) is being detained and questioned over the Saturday shooting death of Jason Walker in Fayetteville, North Carolina" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-31b667059714c5ae src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/06/52794203-10393227-Lieutenant_Jeffrey_Hash_pictured_is_being_detained_and_questione-a-3_1641968499583.jpg height=548 width=470 alt="Lieutenant Jeffrey Hash (pictured) is being detained and questioned over the Saturday shooting death of Jason Walker in Fayetteville, North Carolina" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><img decoding=async id=i-e68f947bdbf64773 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/06/52812559-10393227-Jason_Walker-m-2_1641968495411.jpg height=548 width=468 alt="Jason Walker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-e68f947bdbf64773 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/12/06/52812559-10393227-Jason_Walker-m-2_1641968495411.jpg height=548 width=468 alt="Jason Walker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Lieutenant Jeffrey Hash (left) was detained and questioned over the Saturday shooting death of Jason Walker (right) in Fayetteville, North Carolina</p><img decoding=async id=i-d9ec796fd6391c6d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/11/14/52757869-10390387-Graphic_video_shows_the_scene_after_an_off_duty_police_officer_i-m-18_1641909832163.jpg height=729 width=962 alt="Hash (left) is seen on the phone with 911 operators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Saturday.
