"A woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way — that’s taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist."</p><p>Poehler and Swift were then asked to present at the following Golden Globes.

The first time this happened is when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus was asked about Swift's group of friends</a> and if she was a part of that.</p><p>"I’m not trying to be in the squad,” Cyrus explained. "None of my friends are famous and not because of any other reason than I just like real people who are living real lives, because I’m inspired by them."</p><p>After Cyrus was taken to task for her performance at the VMAs when she performed "Blurred Lines" with Robin Thicke. As such, when she was asked about the "Bad Blood" video that Swift released, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus did not hold back</a>.</p><p>"I don’t get the violence revenge thing. That’s supposed to be a good example?" Cyrus asked. "And I’m a bad role model because I’m running around with my titties out? I’m not sure how titties are worse than guns."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, after Cyrus won a Grammy for "Flowers" in 2024, Swift cheered her on.
