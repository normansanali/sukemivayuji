data-ordinal=2>Travis Barker</a>, or Kravis as they're affectionately known, were friends (and next-door neighbors) first — until one day, they realized they were meant to be together. "We fell in love, and now he's my boyfriend," as Kourtney put it simply.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They officially went public with their relationship in February 2021, and ever since, the crazy-in-love couple has upped the ante on celebrity PDA, often spotted touching tongues on the red carpet and frenching at family dinners — all while wearing coordinating black leather, of course.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years and three weddings later, they're expecting their first child together. To see how they got here, take a look back at Kourtney and Travis's whirlwind romance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>January 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker first spark dating rumors.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumors began to swirl that things officially turned romantic between Kourtney and Travis, who had been friends for years after they both shared two snaps of the same poolside view in Palm Springs on their respective Instagram pages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They've been dating for about a month or two," a source previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "Travis has liked her for a while."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>February 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker go Instagram official.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kourtney and Travis finally confirmed the rumors were true and went Instagram official two days after Valentine's Day. In a caption-less photo shared to her grid, Kourtney held onto the Blink-182 drummer's tattooed hand while sitting in the front seat of a car.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>April 2021: Travis Barker got Kourtney Kardashian's name tattooed on his chest.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis declared his love to Kourtney in the most public (and painful) way possible and tattooed her name in a cursive font on his chest — just above his left nipple, to be exact. This was the second of two Kourtney-inspired tattoos. The first was a doodle of the phrase "you're so cool" in what appeared to be Kourtney's handwriting on his upper thigh. The tattoo was assumed to be a reference to the title song in the 1993 film&nbsp;True Romance — one of the couple's favorite movies.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>August 2021: Travis Barker takes his first flight with Kourtney Kardashian since surviving his 2008 plane crash.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On August 15, 2021, Travis flew for the first time in thirteen years since a deadly 2008 plane crash left the drummer with third-degree burns on more than half of his body. He and Kourtney traveled to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Kylie Jenner's private jet before they made their way to Europe, visiting both Italy and Paris.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis revealed that he never planned on flying again until he started dating Kourtney during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nylon</a> the following month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's still something very new to me, but having something that gives me the strength and hope to be able to overcome things that were so traumatic in my life, it just says a ton," he said. "[Kourtney]'s definitely that for me. I'm invincible when I'm with her. It's just like I never dreamed. I never even considered flying again."<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker make their red carpet debut.&nbsp;</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After nine months of dating, Kourtney and Travis made their highly-anticipated red-carpet debut at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards, and their first joint appearance was anything but subtle. Matching in all-black outfits, the couple took their PDA to the next level and touched tongues, which would later become their signature move, as they stopped for photos.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>October 2021: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are engaged.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Travis asked Kourtney to marry him in Montecito, California, at the Rosewood Miramar Hotel on the beach while they were surrounded by hundreds of roses and candles. Capturing the romantic moment on Instagram, Kourtney shared several photos from the proposal, writing "forever" in the caption and tagging her new fiancé. Afterward, they joined Kourtney's family and Barker's kids — Landon, Alabama, and Atiana — for a celebratory dinner back at the resort.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>April 2022: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have a "practice" wedding in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following their loved-up appearance at the 2022 Grammy Awards, Kourtney and Travis had an impromptu wedding at the One Love Wedding Chapel, where they were married by an Elvis impersonator. Kourtney later revealed that they didn't obtain a marriage license before the ceremony, sharing on Instagram: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"Practice makes perfect."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On an episode of The Kardashians, Kourtney revealed that she was "black-out drunk" during the wedding. "I blacked out," Kardashian told her good friend Simon Huck while filming the show. "I didn't even remember Elvis, like, sang to me walking down the aisle. I didn't remember I had a bouquet." The Poosh founder then shared what she did remember from her wild night. "I did throw up after, though, and took my top off and unbuttoned my pants," she added during a confessional. "I had to walk back through the hotel with a million people taking my photo. I was a hot slob kabob."&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2022: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker get married — again.&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On May 15, 2022, Kourtney and Travis got legally married at the courthouse in Santa Barbara. Kourtney's grandmother, Mary Jo "MJ" Campbell, was there as a witness, as was Travis's dad, Randy. The civil ceremony took place just a week before their lavish nuptials in Portofino, Italy, that spanned several days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When we talk about our wedding to our kids, we're not gonna be like, 'Oh, we just got married in Los Angeles, or we just got married in the desert or San Francisco or Utah.' It had to be Italy, Portofino," Travis said on the couple's Hulu wedding special Til Death Do Us Part. "We wanted to say that."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>September 2022: Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker take a break from IVF.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"After eight months of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>IVF [in-vitro fertilization] journey</a>, we took a break and wanted to try things naturally," Kourtney revealed during season 2 of The Kardashians. "The doctors had told us that we still have some really good-looking follicles and that it was the best they've seen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "Everyone involved, including our natural doctors, felt we should give it one more shot with an IVF retrieval. And so we did one final egg retrieval, and we are just waiting on the genetic testing results, but it has made it to an embryo."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>May 2023: Kourtney Kardashian reveals she and Travis Barker officially ended their IVF journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kourtney continued to open up about her fertility journey on The Kardashians.

During a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles, Kourtney waved around a handwritten sign that read "Travis I'm Pregnant" while dressed in a sheer black bodysuit that showed off her bump and low-rise leather pants. The couple later revealed that they are having <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a baby boy</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kourtney is already a mom to three children — Mason, 13, Penelope, 10, and 8-year-old Reign — whom she shares with her ex Scott Disick, while Travis also has three kids with his ex Shanna Moakler, including son Landon, 19, daughter Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqisq6yemsZut8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nTq5ivoaNir6K%2Byp6pZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV1shXKAk2pv</p></div><div id=links><a href=./miley-cyrus-dedicated-wonder-woman-sinead-oconnor-7853000.html>&#171;&nbsp;Miley Cyrus Dedicated Her Performance of &amp;quot;Wonder Woman&amp;quot; to Sinad O'Connor</a>
