While fines and penalties are common in professional sports, suspensions are reserved for the most severe offenses. In this article, we will take a closer look at the top 10 longest suspensions in NFL history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>1. Art Schlichter - Indefinite Suspension</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Art Schlichter, a former quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, holds the record for the longest suspension in NFL history. In 1987, Schlichter was banned indefinitely from the league due to his involvement in illegal gambling activities. Despite numerous attempts at reinstatement, Schlichter was never allowed to play in the NFL again.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>2. Josh Gordon - Indefinite Suspension</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Josh Gordon, a talented wide receiver, has had a tumultuous career marked by repeated suspensions for substance abuse. In 2019, Gordon received an indefinite suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. While he has been reinstated multiple times, his struggles with addiction have hampered his ability to have a sustained presence in the league.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>3. Albert Haynesworth - 5 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Albert Haynesworth, a former defensive tackle, received a five-game suspension in 2006 for stomping on the head of Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode during a game. The incident was not only a clear violation of the league's rules but also a dangerous act that put Gurode's health at risk.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>4. Ndamukong Suh - 2 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ndamukong Suh, known for his aggressive and sometimes controversial playing style, received a two-game suspension in 2011 for stomping on the arm of Green Bay Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Suh's history of on-field incidents led to the league taking a strong stance against his actions.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>5. Vontaze Burfict - 12 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Vontaze Burfict, a former linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals, received a 12-game suspension in 2019 for repeated violations of the league's player safety rules. Burfict had a reputation for dirty hits and dangerous play, and the suspension was intended to send a clear message that such behavior would not be tolerated.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>6. Sean Payton - 1 Year</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2012, Sean Payton, the head coach of the New Orleans Saints, received a one-year suspension for his involvement in the "Bountygate" scandal. The scandal involved the Saints' defense offering financial rewards to players who injured opponents. Payton's suspension was a strong statement by the league that such conduct would not be tolerated.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>7. Tom Brady - 4 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tom Brady, widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, received a four-game suspension in 2016 for his involvement in the "Deflategate" scandal. The scandal centered around allegations that Brady had knowledge of and played a role in deflating footballs to gain a competitive advantage. The suspension was later overturned, but it remains one of the most high-profile cases in NFL history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>8. Antonio Smith - 1 Game</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Antonio Smith, a defensive end for the Houston Texans, received a one-game suspension in 2013 for swinging his helmet at Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Richie Incognito during a preseason game. The incident was a clear violation of the league's rules and demonstrated a dangerous lack of self-control.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>9. Ezekiel Elliott - 6 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Ezekiel Elliott, a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, received a six-game suspension in 2017 for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension was related to allegations of domestic violence. Despite the controversy, Elliott has since returned to the field and continued to excel as a player.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>10. Adrian Peterson - 6 Games</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Adrian Peterson, one of the most accomplished running backs in NFL history, received a six-game suspension in 2014 for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension was a result of child abuse charges against Peterson. While the incident tarnished his reputation, Peterson has since bounced back and continued to have a successful career.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The NFL has handed out significant suspensions over the years for a variety of offenses. Whether it's for illegal gambling, substance abuse, dangerous play, or off-field misconduct, the league has made it clear that certain actions will not be tolerated. These top 10 longest suspensions in NFL history serve as a reminder that players, coaches, and staff are held to a high standard both on and off the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lpKS9bn2PZqOoppeawLV50q6qqZ2eqLawutJmoKdlnpu5brTIrKuoqqk%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./uss-indianapolis-wreck-discovered.html>&#171;&nbsp;USS Indianapolis Wreck Discovered 72 Years After Tragic Demise</a>
